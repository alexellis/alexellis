Learn the use-cases for serverless functions through pratical exercises. You'll deploy your own self-hosted faasd instance, write code in Node.js and using examples will start to call HTTP APIs, add npm modules and understand how to monitor your code.

You can run it on your laptop, a Raspberry Pi or DigitalOcean Droplet.

Wanting to learn what can be done? Start here. Already a faasd user? This is the official handbook.
