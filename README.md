## Follow my journey and support my Open Source work

As a GitHub Sponsor, you'll hear from me every week by email - covering my journey building independent software and open source projects. I share about new features, updates, events, tutorials and often share what I've learned from reading and executing every day.

### üìö My first eBook - Serverless for Everyone Else

<img src="https://www.alexellis.io/serverless.png" width="40%"></a>

Learn the use-cases for serverless functions through practical exercises. You'll deploy your own self-hosted functions, write code in Node.js and using examples will start to call HTTP APIs, add npm modules and understand how to monitor your code with Grafana.

Get the eBook on its own, or upgrade to the video workshop.

### Take my Netbooting workshop for the Raspberry Pi

You only need a single server and a single Raspberry Pi to experience the magic of a diskless boot. It still mesmerises me every time I see a machine boot up. You can then remotely manage each host, update them and have faster, more reliable storage. Plus I'll guide you on special settings for running K3s, Docker and faasd.

You'll setup your server with NFS and TFTP, configure filesystems for each of the RPis, get them booting up, measure the speed, then setup K3s in a HA configuration. From there you can learn what to deploy on the cluster, and find a few jump off points for going further.
