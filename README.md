Learn the use-cases for serverless functions through practical exercises. You'll deploy your own self-hosted functions, write code in Node.js and using examples will start to call HTTP APIs, add npm modules and understand how to monitor your code with Grafana.

### Buy a one of a kind wrist rest for your mechanical keyboard

I make keyboard wrist rests using hand tools only, and brand them with an openfaas logo. These can be made to custom sizes and come with free stickers.
