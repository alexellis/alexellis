Learn the use-cases for serverless functions through practical exercises. You'll deploy your own self-hosted functions, write code in Node.js and using examples will start to call HTTP APIs, add npm modules and understand how to monitor your code.

You can run it on your laptop, a Raspberry Pi or a DigitalOcean Droplet from 5 USD / mo.

## Every good player deserves a coach

Coaching and mentoring isn't about telling you what to do, you know that already. It's not about teaching you things you can learn on your own. It's about asking you the right questions, making suggestions and keeping you accountable so that you can grow and reach your goals.
