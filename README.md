Learn the use-cases for serverless functions through practical exercises. You'll deploy your own self-hosted functions, write code in Node.js and using examples will start to call HTTP APIs, add npm modules and understand how to monitor your code with Grafana.

Get the eBook on its own, or upgrade to the video workshop. Learn what Serverless and Functions can do for you.
